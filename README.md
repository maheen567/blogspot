## Blog Website with Next.js and Dynamic Routing

I developed a responsive multi-page blog website using Next.js and custom CSS, designed to deliver an engaging and seamless user experience. The website leverages Next.js dynamic routing with server-side rendering (SSR) to dynamically fetch and display blog content, ensuring efficient data handling and optimized performance. A built-in comment section allows users to share their thoughts and interact directly on each blog post, enhancing user engagement.

## Key Features
